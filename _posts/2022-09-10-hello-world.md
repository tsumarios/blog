Hello, World!
<!-- readmore -->

**Welcome to my new blog!**

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23482292" alt="Profile Pic" height="200">

After few attempts on undestanding how to use Jekyll within Github Pages I managed to publish my blog (at least if you are seeing this, then it works!).

## Why this blog?

I decided to create a blog under my [main Website](https://tsumarios.github.io/) to:

- avoid spreading posts all over different places;
- gather my notes and resource in one place;
- hopefully share my knowledge to the community.

### Stay Tuned

The bootstrap phase includes the relocation of some articles of mine from other platforms into this blog. After that, more posts will be added with brand-new content, so consider subscribing to the [RSS feed](https://tsumarios.github.io/blog/feed.xml) if you don't want to miss anything.

Feel free to follow me also on my socials to stay updated on new posts:
