Hello, World!
<!-- readmore -->

**Welcome to my new blog!**

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/23482292" alt="Profile Pic" height="200">

After a few attempts on understanding how to use Jekyll within Github Pages, I managed to publish my blog (or at least if you are reading this, it means it works!).

## Why this blog?

The decision to create a blog under my [main Website](https://tsumarios.github.io/) stems from a few key reasons:

- *Centralisation* - to avoid scattering my posts across different platforms, I've brought them all together here;
- *Knowledge Hub* - this blog serves as a repository for my notes and resources, making them easily accessible;
- *Community Sharing* - the goal is to share my knowledge and research with the community.

As a result, this blog will primarily feature **cybersecurity-related** articles, tutorials and resources.

### Stay Tuned

The bootstrap phase includes the relocation of some articles of mine from other platforms into this blog. After that, more posts will be added with brand-new content, so consider subscribing to the [RSS feed](https://tsumarios.github.io/blog/feed.xml) if you don't want to miss anything.

Also, feel free to follow me on my socials to stay updated on new posts:
