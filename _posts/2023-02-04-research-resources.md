## General Research Resources

The following websites provide useful resources for researchers.

### Anonymous GitHub

*URL*: <https://anonymous.4open.science/>

Anonymous GitHub allows you to simply anonymize your GitHub repository. Several anonymisation options are available to ensure that you do not break the double-anonymise such as removing links, images or specific terms. You still keep control of your repository and define an expiration date to make your repository unavailable after the review.

Conference Ranks is a website that allows you to lookup the rank of a conference.

### Connected Papers

*URL*: <https://www.connectedpapers.com/>
