## General Research Resources

The following websites provide useful resources for researchers.

### Anonymous GitHub

*URL*: <https://anonymous.4open.science/>

Anonymous GitHub allows you to simply anonymize your GitHub repository. Several anonymisation options are available to ensure that you do not break the double-anonymise such as removing links, images or specific terms. You still keep control of your repository and define an expiration date to make your repository unavailable after the review.

### ChatGPT

*URL*: <https://chatgpt.com/>

ChatGPT is a chatbot and virtual assistant developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. Based on Large Language Models (LLMs), it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language.

### Conference Ranks

*URL*: <https://www.conferenceranks.com>
*URL*: <https://scie.lcc.uma.es/>

Conference Ranks and GII-GRIN-SCIE (GGS) Conference Rating are websites that allow you to lookup the rank of a conference.

### Connected Papers

*URL*: <https://www.connectedpapers.com/>

Connected Papers is a visual tool to help researchers and applied scientists find academic papers relevant to their field of work.

### Elicit

*URL*: <https://elicit.org/>

Elicit can find relevant papers without perfect keyword matches, summarise takeaways from the paper specific to your question, and extract key information from the papers.

### Google Scholar

*URL*: <https://scholar.google.com/>

Google Scholar is a freely accessible web search engine that indexes the full text or metadata of scholarly literature across an array of publishing formats and disciplines.

### Grammarly

*URL*: <https://www.grammarly.com/>

Grammarly is an American cloud-based typing assistant. It reviews spelling, grammar, punctuation, clarity, engagement, and delivery mistakes in English texts, detects plagiarism and suggests replacements for the identified errors. It also allows users to customise their style, tone, and context-specific language.

*A valid open-source alternative is Language Tool:* <https://languagetool.org/>.

### Incident DBs

The following websites provide databases on cybersecurity, privacy, and/or AI-related incidents, events, and vulnerabilities.

*Disclaimer: most of the DBs linked in this subsection are extracted from <https://shostack.org/resources/lessons>.*
