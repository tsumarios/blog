Welcome to my new blog!

I'm Mario Raciti (aka tsumarios) and I'm a Security Researcher who after few attempts on undestanding how to use Jekyll within Github Pages managed to publish his own blog (or at least if you are seeing this, then it works!).

*If you want to know more about me, please consider visiting my [Website's About](https://tsumarios.github.io/#about) section.*

## Why this blog?

I decided to create a blog under my [main Website](https://tsumarios.github.io/) to:

- avoid spreading posts all over different places;
- gather my notes and resource in one place;
- hopefully share my knowledge to the community.

So this blog is supposed to provide useful **cybersecurity-related** articles, tutorials and resources.
